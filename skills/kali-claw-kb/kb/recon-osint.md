## Summary

Information gathering determines the precision and efficiency of subsequent attacks.

**Domain**: osint

**MITRE ATT&CK**: TA0043-Reconnaissance

## Description

The most critical first step in penetration testing. Information gathering determines the precision and efficiency of subsequent attacks. This skill covers three major areas: passive reconnaissance (OSINT), active reconnaissance (port scanning, service identification), and web fingerprinting — from domain enumeration to directory bruteforcing, building a complete target profile. Mastered tools include nmap, dig, whois, whatweb, wpscan, gobuster, theHarvester, sublist3r, assetfinder, dirb, zenmap, as well as tools currently being learned: maltego, photon, recon-ng, ffuf, dnsenum, fierce, etc.

## Use Cases

- Pre-engagement reconnaissance for penetration testing: comprehensive information gathering on the target, mapping the attack surface
- Red team exercise asset discovery: enumerating subdomains, IP ranges, open services, finding weak entry points
- Security assessment and compliance audits: identifying exposed surfaces, unauthorized services, information leakage
- CTF competition information gathering phase: rapidly locating target services and attack paths
- Threat intelligence tracking: collecting information about the target organization's personnel, emails, and technology stack

## Core Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Command Example |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| nmap | Port scanning and service identification | `nmap -sV -sC -O -p- target` |
| dig / whois | DNS enumeration and domain information lookup | `dig any example.com @8.8.8.8` |
| theHarvester | Email, subdomain, and IP collection | `theHarvester -d example.com -b all` |
| sublist3r / assetfinder | Subdomain enumeration | `sublist3r -d example.com -t 50` |
| gobuster / ffuf | Directory and file bruteforcing | `gobuster dir -u http://target -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt` |
| whatweb / wpscan | Web fingerprinting and CMS identification | `whatweb http://target && wpscan --url http://target` |
| recon-ng | Modular web reconnaissance framework | `recon-ng > use recon/domains-hosts/google_domain_scraper` |
| maltego | Visual OSINT correlation analysis | GUI: Domain -> To DNS Names -> To IP Address |

## Methodology

### Attack Chain

**Step 1: Passive Recon**

No direct interaction with the target, minimizing exposure risk. Collect domain registration information, DNS records, search engine caches, and social media data.

**Step 2: Subdomain and Asset Discovery**

Enumerate all subdomains and associated assets to expand the attack surface. Cross-validate with multiple tools to avoid missing targets.

**Step 3: Active Scanning and Service Identification**

Perform port scanning and service version identification on discovered assets, building a service inventory.

**Step 4: Web Application Fingerprinting and Directory Enumeration**

Identify web technology stacks, CMS, and framework versions; bruteforce hidden directories and files.

**Step 5: OSINT Deep Correlation Analysis**

Cross-correlate collected information and build a complete attack surface map.

## Practical Steps

### Exercise 1: Full Domain Reconnaissance Workflow

1. Basic domain information lookup (whois + dig)
2. Multi-tool subdomain enumeration with cross-validation (sublist3r + assetfinder + dnsenum)
3. Merge, deduplicate, and verify liveness (sort + httpx)

### Exercise 2: Target Network Port Scanning

1. Rapid live host discovery (nmap -sn)
2. Full port deep scan (nmap -sS -sV -sC -O -p-)
3. Visual analysis (zenmap)

### Exercise 3: Web Application Deep Scanning

1. Technology stack identification (whatweb)
2. CMS-specific scanning (wpscan)
3. Dual-tool directory bruteforce verification (dirb + gobuster)

### Exercise 4: Deep Crawling and Correlation Analysis

1. Comprehensive target website crawling (photon)
2. Automated information correlation (recon-ng)
3. Visual correlation analysis (maltego)

## Defense Evasion Techniques

### Stealth Reconnaissance
- **Passive over active**: Prefer `crt.sh` (CT logs) over `nmap`; no packets hit target.
- **Rate limiting**: Cap queries below detection threshold.
- **Distributed source IPs**: Use residential proxies for active recon.
- **Off-hours timing**: Active scans during target's off-hours.
- **Source port spoofing**: Use `--source-port 53` to look like DNS; bypasses some firewalls.

### Search Engine Dorking Stealth
- **Multi-engine**: Distribute dorking across Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yandex.
- **Natural language queries**: Avoid obvious `inurl:admin`; use natural language.
- **Cached content access**: Use `cache:` operator or archive.org; no traffic to target.
- **Search Console manipulation**: Use scripted Google searches via legitimate API; evade anti-bot.

### Code Repository Recon Stealth
- **GitHub API over search**: Use `api.github.com/search/code` (rate-limited but less suspicious).
- **Fork before analyze**: Fork target repo privately; avoid revealing interest via clones.
- **TruffleHog locally**: Run secret scanners locally; don't upload to third-party services.
