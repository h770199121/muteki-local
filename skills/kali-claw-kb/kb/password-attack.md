## Summary

Password Attack skill domain covering credential access operations.

**Tools**: hashcat, john, hydra, medusa, cewl, crunch

**Domain**: credential-access

**MITRE ATT&CK**: TA0006-Credential Access

## Description

Password attacks encompass the complete attack chain from hash extraction, hash type identification, dictionary attacks, rule-based attacks, and bruteforcing to online service brute forcing. Core attack techniques include dictionary attack, rule-based attack, rainbow table, mask attack, as well as two fundamentally different attack paradigms: online brute force vs offline hash cracking.

Offline attacks target already-obtained hashes (e.g., NTLM, SHA, bcrypt), where attack speed is limited only by hardware and does not trigger target system alerts. Online attacks target remote services (SSH, HTTP, databases) and must contend with defenses such as rate limiting and account lockout.

**Key Insight**: The essence of password attacks is a game of probability and time — dictionary quality determines hit rate, rule engines expand coverage, hardware compute power determines speed, and defense strategies determine the feasibility of online attacks.

## Use Cases

1. **Post-Exploitation Credential Extraction** - Extract hashes from SAM database, /etc/shadow, Kerberos TGT, etc., and crack them offline for lateral movement
2. **Web Application Authentication Testing** - Perform online dictionary/brute force attacks against login forms and API endpoints to assess password policy strength
3. **File Password Recovery** - Crack password protection on ZIP, PDF, Office documents, KeePass databases, 1Password, and other encrypted files
4. **CTF Password Cracking** - Rapidly identify hash types and select optimal attack modes and dictionaries to complete challenges
5. **Red Team Custom Dictionary Construction** - Generate customized dictionaries based on target organization information (website content, employee names, corporate culture)

## Methodology

### Attack Chain

```
Hash Extraction     Hash Identification   Dictionary/Rule      Offline Cracking
(secretsdump,      (hash-iid,           Selection            (hashcat/john,
 /etc/shadow)       hashcat -I)          (rockyou/cewl/        rules/masks)
                                         crunch/mangling)         |                   |                  |                  |
       v               v                  v                  v
Credential          Online Brute        Credential          Lateral Movement
Verification        Force               Stuffing/Spray      (impacket/wmiexec)
(verify cracked     (hydra/medusa)
 results)
```

**Phase Details**:

1. **Hash Extraction** - Obtain password hashes from target systems: Windows (SAM/NTDS.dit), Linux (/etc/shadow), databases (MySQL/PostgreSQL hash), application configuration files
2. **Hash Identification** - Determine the hash algorithm type and select the correct hashcat mode or john format, which directly affects cracking success rate
3. **Dictionary/Rule Selection** - Select base dictionaries based on target characteristics, combined with rule engines (best64/dive/T0XlC) and mask attacks to expand coverage
4. **Offline Cracking** - Dictionary attack -> Rule attack -> Combination attack -> Mask bruteforce, executed in order of increasing cost-effectiveness
5. **Online Brute Force** - Authentication testing against remote services, controlling concurrency and speed to avoid triggering defenses
6. **Credential Stuffing / Password Spraying** - Try cracked credentials against other services, or test many accounts with a few common passwords
7. **Lateral Movement** - Use obtained credentials to expand access within the target network

### Core Workflow Overview

1. **Hashcat Offline Cracking** - Identify hash type (`--identify`), then progressively attack in order: dictionary -> rules -> combination -> mask
2. **John the Ripper Flexible Cracking** - Use `--single` mode to generate candidate passwords from username/GECOS information; use `2john` tools to extract file hashes
3. **Hydra Online Brute Force** - Supports 50+ protocols; control concurrency (`-t`) and interval (`-W`) to avoid triggering defenses
4. **Custom Dictionaries** - Three-layer dictionary construction strategy: cewl website keyword crawling + crunch pattern generation + rule mutation
5. **Hash Type Identification** - Quickly determine algorithm type through prefix features (`$2b$`, `$6$`, `$kerberoast$`) and length

## Defense Evasion Techniques

Evade detection during authorized password testing by: throttling online brute force attempts to match normal authentication patterns rather than aggressive parallelism, distributing requests across multiple source IPs or through a proxy chain, using password spraying (one password against many accounts) rather than targeted brute force to reduce per-account failure counts, and scheduling attacks during business hours when authentication noise is naturally higher. For offline cracking, perform hash cracking on isolated GPU rigs that are not monitored by endpoint detection tools.

## Advanced Techniques

Advanced password attack techniques include: combinator attacks that join words from two separate dictionaries (effective against passphrase policies), prince attacks that generate candidate passwords by combining random dictionary substrings, keyboard-walk pattern generation for passwords like "qwerty123", mask attacks informed by the target's password policy structure (e.g., `?u?l?l?l?l?d?d?d?s` for "Capital + 4 lowercase + 3 digits + special"), and using machine learning models trained on leaked password databases to generate statistically likely candidates that bypass traditional dictionaries.
